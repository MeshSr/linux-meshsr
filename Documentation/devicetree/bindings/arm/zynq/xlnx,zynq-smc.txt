Device tree bindings for Zynq's SMC (PL353)

The SMC supports NAND, NOR and SRAM memory. The SMC driver handles generic
tasks, while children drivers handle memory type specifics.

Required properties:
 compatible: Compatibility string. Must be "xlnx,ps7-smc".
 reg: Specify the base and size of the SMC registers in the memory map.
      E.g.: reg = <0xe000e000 0x1000>;
 #address-cells: Address cells, must be 1.
 #size-cells: Size cells. Must be 1.
 ranges

Child nodes:
 For NAND the "xlnx,ps7-nand" and for NOR the "cfi-flash" drivers are supported
 as child nodes.

Example:
	ps7_smc_0: ps7-smc@e000e000 {
		compatible = "xlnx,ps7-smc";
		reg = <0xe000e000 0x1000>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		ranges;

		ps7_nand_0: ps7-nand@e1000000 {
			compatible = "xlnx,ps7-nand-1.00.a";
			(...)
		};
	};
