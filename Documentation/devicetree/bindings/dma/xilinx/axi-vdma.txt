Xilinx AXI VDMA engine, it does transfers between memory and video devices.
It can be configured to have one channel or two channels. If configured
as two channels, one is to transmit to the video device and another is
to receive from the video device.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "xlnx,axi-vdma"
- #dma-cells: Should be <1>, see "dmas" property below
- reg: Should contain VDMA registers location and length.
- interrupts: Should contain per channel VDMA interrupts.
- compatible (child node): It should be either "xlnx,axi-vdma-mm2s-channel" or
	"xlnx,axi-vdma-s2mm-channel". It depends on the hardware design and it
	can also have both channels.
- xlnx,device-id: Should contain device number in each channel. It should be
	{0,1,2...so on} to the number of VDMA devices configured in hardware.
- xlnx,num-fstores: Should be the number of framebuffers as configured in h/w.
- xlnx,data-width: Should contain the stream data width, takes {32,64...so on}.
- xlnx,flush-fsync: (Optional) Tells whether which channel to Flush on Fsync.
	It takes following values:
	{1}, flush both channels
	{2}, flush mm2s channel
	{3}, flush s2mm channel
- xlnx,include-sg: (Optional) Tells whether configured for Scatter-mode in
	the hardware.
- xlnx,include-dre: (Optional) Tells whether hardware is configured for Data
	Realignment Engine.
- xlnx,genlock-mode: (Optional) Tells whether Genlock synchornisation is
	enabled/disabled in hardware.

Example:

axi_vdma_0: axivdma@40030000 {
	compatible = "xlnx,axi-vdma";
	#dma_cells = <1>;
	reg = < 0x40030000 0x10000 >;
	xlnx,flush-fsync = <0x1>;
	dma-channel@40030000 {
		compatible = "xlnx,axi-vdma-mm2s-channel";
		interrupts = < 0 54 4 >;
		xlnx,num-fstores = <0x8>;
		xlnx,device-id = <0x0>;
		xlnx,datawidth = <0x40>;
	} ;
	dma-channel@40030030 {
		compatible = "xlnx,axi-vdma-s2mm-channel";
		interrupts = < 0 53 4 >;
		xlnx,num-fstores = <0x8>;
		xlnx,device-id = <0x0>;
		xlnx,datawidth = <0x40>;
	} ;
} ;


* Xilinx Video DMA client

Required properties:
- dmas: a list of <[Video DMA device phandle] [Channel ID]> pairs,
	where Channel ID is '0' for write/tx and '1' for read/rx
	channel.
- dma-names: a list of DMA channel names, one per "dmas" entry

VDMA Test Client Example:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

vdmatest_0: vdmatest@0 {
	compatible ="xlnx,axi-vdma-test";
	dmas = <&axi_vdma_0 0
		&axi_vdma_0 1>;
	dma-names = "vdma0", "vdma1";
} ;
